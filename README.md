  <b>AWS Solution Architect Video Downscaler</b>
</h1>

<h2>📌 Overview</h2>
<p>The application processes and downscales videos uploaded to an S3 bucket, ensuring efficient storage and seamless delivery for end users. This project showcases my expertise in designing a <b>highly available (HA)</b>, <b>fault-tolerant (FT)</b>, and <b>disaster-resilient (DR)</b> solution using <b>AWS services</b>. The architecture is built to ensure <b>uninterrupted service</b> by distributing workloads across multiple <b>Availability Zones (AZs)</b> and incorporating <b>automated failover mechanisms</b>. It also features <b>robust disaster recovery strategies</b> to protect data and maintain <b>business continuity</b> during failures or disasters.</p>

<h2>🚀 Key Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>CI/CD Pipeline:</b> Implemented GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.</li>
  <li><b>Infrastructure as Code (IaC):</b> Used Terraform to provision and manage AWS resources.</li>
  <li><b>Scalable Architecture:</b> Utilized AWS Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) to dynamically manage EC2 instances based on workload.</li>
  <li><b>Serverless Integration:</b> Used <b>AWS SNS</b> and <b>AWS SQS</b> for a <b>pub/sub pattern</b> to decouple services and enable asynchronous communication.</li>
  <li><b>Application Load Balancer (ALB):</b> Configured ALB to distribute traffic across EC2 instances.</li>
  <li><b>Containerization:</b> Dockerized the video processing application for portability and consistency.</li>
</ul>



<h2>🧠 Skills Demonstrated</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Cloud Architecture:</b> Designed a fault-tolerant, highly available, and disaster recovery system on AWS.</li>
  <li><b>DevOps:</b> Automated infrastructure provisioning and deployment using Terraform and GitHub Actions.</li>
  <li><b>Containerization:</b> Built and deployed Docker containers for consistent runtime environments.</li>
  <li><b>Networking:</b> Configured VPC, subnets, and security groups for secure and efficient communication.</li>
  <li><b>Cost Optimization:</b> Implemented S3 lifecycle policies and efficient resource scaling.</li>
</ul>
